This is a great way to practice conditional formatting and some light VBA scripting.  Lots of fun.  


Some minor add-ons and modifications:
--You can choose difference PNG art for buttons.  I chose the Grinch.
--The VBA loop runs for 2021 iterations, causing the sheet to give the blue circle of death while the tree cycled  One thing I did was change the loop to run 5 times and added a 1 second delay to each step of the loop so the macro doesn't hijack Excel from the user for more than 5 seconds.
